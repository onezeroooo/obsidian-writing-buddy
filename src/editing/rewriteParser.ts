/**
 * Extracting a replacement candidate from what the backend returned.
 *
 * The contract is that a rewrite adapter ends with
 * `{"type":"result","result":{"replacement":"…"}}`, and when that happens this
 * module has nothing to do. The rest of the file exists because models are
 * imperfect: a replacement can arrive wrapped in a code fence, prefixed with a
 * sentence of commentary, or as a bare JSON object in the streamed text.
 *
 * The i18n import below serves only the two user-facing failure reasons; the
 * fence labels further down are model-protocol vocabulary and stay literal.
 *
 * The one rule that must not bend: **the replacement string itself is never
 * trimmed.** Leading and trailing whitespace inside the candidate is content —
 * it may be an indented line or a deliberate blank. Only the envelope around it
 * (the JSON wrapper, the code fence, the stray commentary) may be stripped.

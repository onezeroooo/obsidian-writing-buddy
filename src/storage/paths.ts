/**
 * Where WritingBuddy keeps project data.
 *
 * Everything under the project root lives *inside the vault*, so a
 * conversation belongs to the manuscript and travels with it through whatever
 * sync the writer already uses. Nothing here is machine-specific, and nothing
 * here may ever contain a credential — see `DeviceStore` for that.
 *
 * The root defaults to `WritingBuddy/`, deliberately **not** dot-prefixed:
 *
 *   - A dot-folder is hidden content as far as Obsidian is concerned. Syncing
 *     it requires Self-hosted LiveSync's Hidden File Sync, which is opt-in,
 *     slower, and conflict-prone. Ordinary folders sync with no special setup.
 *   - Hidden paths are also second-class to the vault adapter and are excluded
 *     from Obsidian's file index, which removes the ability to cross-check an
 *     enumeration against `vault.getFiles()`.
 *
 * It is a plain folder name, sitting among the writer's own. It carried a
 * leading underscore for a while to sort it to the top and mark it as
 * machinery, which is a convention from tooling rather than from manuscripts —
 * and this folder is the writer's data, not the plugin's scratch space.
 *
 * Because it is the writer's folder, **where it sits is the writer's choice**
 * (D-047). The root is a runtime value: the plugin reads it from its own
 * `data.json` at load, follows the folder when the writer drags or renames it
 * in the file tree, and offers a Settings row for the cases a drag cannot
 * cover. Every path below is therefore a getter that reads the current root,
 * never a constant captured at import time — a module that captured the
 * default would keep writing to the old location after a move.
 *
 * What is *not* the writer's choice is the shape inside the root. The fixed
 * children listed in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE` are the plugin's contract with
 * itself; moving one of them out is put back, not followed.
 *
 * Project data must never live inside `.obsidian/` either: that folder is
 * app configuration, is hidden, and is frequently excluded from sync.

 * is rare, its failure mode is recomputation rather than loss, and it is not
 * worth a folder that grows without bound inside a quota. Local resume — the
 * common case, and the one `Continue` exists for — is unaffected.
 *
 * Conversations do not move here. They are the writer's own history, they are
 * meant to travel between devices, and PC-014 puts them somewhere visible.
 *

 * the vault, and staying at the vault root keeps it outside sync wherever the

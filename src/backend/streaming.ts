 * attempted when the plugin hands the adapter a stream client, and an adapter
 * falls back to `requestUrl` the moment a stream cannot be opened — a browser
 * refusing the cross-origin request, a server that ignores `stream: true` and
 * answers with JSON — so a writer on a phone still gets an answer, just not

/**
 * The sidebar: state, behaviour, and orchestration.
 *
 * Rendering lives in `components/`. What remains here is the conversation
 * lifecycle, the rewrite flow, and the one piece of DOM cleverness worth
 * having: during generation only the streaming node is patched, instead of
 * rebuilding the whole transcript on every token.
 *
 * Three properties of this file are load-bearing.
 *
 * **Every turn is visible conversation state.** A writing action fills the
 * composer with an ask the writer can edit. Chat returns prose; rewrite returns
 * a structured candidate that this client turns into a local diff.
 *
 * **Structure is derived from the message, not remembered.** Prose, citations
 * and diffs are read out of the stored answer on every render, so sending the
 * next message, switching conversations or restarting Obsidian leaves an answer
 * looking exactly as it did. Only the writer's own decisions — which diff view,
 * whether it has been applied — are held in memory, because those are the parts
 * that are not in the text.
 *
 * **The manuscript is untouched until 应用.** Generation only ever produces a
 * candidate. The stale check and the exact-range write run when the writer asks
 * for them, and both guards are unchanged from when they ran automatically.

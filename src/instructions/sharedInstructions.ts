/**
 * Shared behavior belongs to the product, not to every individual Skill.

 * through `instructionLocale()` — never at import time, which would freeze
 * whichever language was live when the module loaded. Chinese is the
 * canonical text; the English set is typed against it so a block cannot be
 * added in one language and forgotten in the other.
 *
 * The fence labels the two languages instruct with (```改写后 / ```rewrite,
 * ```续写 / ```continue) are all accepted by `rewriteParser` regardless of
 * language, so a model answering in the "wrong" one still yields a candidate.
